What we did and what we want to do next:

We already have the basis of how to obtain the raw data (still without connections), analyze it and present meaningful information. We have used the Python library circos plot. The next step is to transfer what we have learned to the other plot libraries that were recommended for this project, since we lacked good documentation for circos plot. At the same time, we need to figure out how to get the data from Scholia across multiple sites.


To create a better overview our step 

1. keep github clean with folders
2. how to: understand Structure of Scholia and Wikidata
4. get the data (Schizophrenia and related diseases; measure the relation with some metrics)
5. how to: Sankey diagram
6. tranfer the approaches to Sankey diagram
7. how to: Hive Plot
8. tranfer the approaches to Hive Plot
9. discuss the results
